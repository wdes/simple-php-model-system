# simple-php-model-system

A simple PHP model system

## Why ?

The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to use Models in a non composer setup.
This is why this project is kept very minimal.
The user can copy all classes in `src/` and start using the lib.
But this also works in a composer setup.
